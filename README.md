# Installation

To install this application you will need a text editor like Visual Studio Code. You will also need to install MySQL to your machine. You can install all the node packages via npm install


# Usage

The user can initialize the app using index.js in the project root directory. This project then uses inquirer to prompt the user through a series of questions. Depending on user input, the javascript will then make connection queries to the MySQL database to display data, insert new rows, update rows, or delete rows.
